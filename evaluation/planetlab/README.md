# PlanetLab Testbed Scripts

All scripts in this directory must be run from the root of this repository.

## Workflow

0. Make sure your working directory is the root of this repository.
1. Create a slice on PlanetLab, assign it to user(s) and add servers to it.
2. Populate `servers.txt`, `clients.txt` in `config/`. Duplicate lines will install duplicate instances.
3. Create test structure with `populate_steps.py`
4. Make sure the correct tests are symlinked to evaluation/planetlab/tests-enabled/
5. Install and start service.
6. Run tests.
7. Cleanup.
