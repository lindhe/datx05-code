# CAS

This is the code for the CAS versions we use.

* `SelfStabilizing.py` holds the server class for the self-stabilizing version of
CAS (i.e., CASSS).
* `IncNbrHelper.py` is a helper class for the Reincarnation service.
* `proposal.py` is the class for proposal objects (for the Global Reset)
* `old/` contains the code to CAS_ZMQ, which is a non-self-stabilizing
  implementation of CAS.
